# Movie_Project
The movie project 1 for Udacity 

Project Movie Website
  Includes files 
    entertainment_center.json : a list of the movies to be displayed along with their information.  JSON format
    media.py : the Movies class constructor
    entertainment_center.py : reads the movies information from JSON and creates a list of movie objects 
                              this then opens fresh_tomatoes.py and passes the movie objects to it
    fresh_tomatoes.py : creates the html page fresh_tomatoes.html by coordinating the movie data into
                        a template for movie tiles
    fresh_tomatoes.html: this is auto_generated by the first run of fresh_tomatoes.py  It includes the movie tiles,
                         and ability to play the movie trailers

To run the project, ensure that entertainment_center.json contains the movie data that you want to display, 
in valid JSON format.  Run entertainment_center.py to auto_generate the web page, which should open as soon 
as the page is constructed
On the page, click on a movie tile to see its YouTube trailer.  Hover over the overview text to see what the
movie is about.
